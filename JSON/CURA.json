This will ultimately contribute to achieving the target maturity of 4 for AWS and 3 for Azure respectively. This will only impact OMF where our workloads consume capabilities made available to us by OML.\n\nKey focus areas for 2022 include:\n1.\tAddress controls effectiveness gaps by implementing action plans and track progress monthly\n2.\tBased on the outcomes of the 2021 maturity assessment, develop an improvement plan for us to improve our maturity rating in 2022 and reach our target ratings for cloud (4 for AWS and 3 for Azure) and maintain our on-premises rating of 3.5. This plan will be communicated to us through OML CISO office and will be acted upon once received.\n3.\tEscalate any areas where non-compliance is possible, especially where there is a dependency like the need for specialised technology to achieve control adequacy or effectiveness.\n\nInformation Technology \n\nThe following key initiatives will contribute to the improvements of the IT environment: \n1.\tAdopt a data tagging and protection tool to ensure that data is protected on an ongoing basis. It was identified that the Data Loss Protection (DLP) capability has no coverage for our cloud storage environment. The aim is to align Old mutual’s objectives to provide a holistic view of our security posture, integrate and leverage off existing sensitive information types. \n2.\tSupport OML in the Migration off our current SOC provider due to an issue assurance that identified weaknesses with our current provider and leverage off Microsoft Sentinel as our security event monitoring solution\n3.\tSupport OML with improving the phishing stats and integrate ways to protect the organization from potential cyber-attacks, consequence management will be implemented to track employees that are clicking on phishing simulations and putting the organization at risk. \n",
